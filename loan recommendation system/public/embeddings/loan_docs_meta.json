The \"Hidden\" Costs - Decoding Fee Structures While interest rates are the most visible cost component, a holistic comparison must account for the total cost of borrowing, which is significantly influenced by processing fees and prepayment penalties. The banks' approaches to these charges vary considerably. HDFC Bank, for instance, uses a flat-fee cap for processing (up to ₹6,500), which can be more advantageous for high-value loans compared to the percentage-based fees (up to 2%) charged by ICICI, Axis, and BoB. 17 The most striking difference lies in prepayment policies. ICICI Bank's policy of offering zero foreclosure charges after the payment of just 12 EMIs is a powerful, pro-consumer feature that sets it apart. 35 This provides immense flexibility for borrowers who anticipate future liquidity and wish to close their loans early without incurring heavy penalties.
